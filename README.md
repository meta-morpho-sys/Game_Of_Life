# Game Of Life

As a player
So I can see the state of the system
I want to print out the grid of cells

As a player
So I can set up the grid
I want to create a board with specific cells living

As a player
So I can see the system change slowly
I want to step the system forward one step

As a player
So I can see a realistic game of life
I want cells to die if they have fewer than two neighbours

As a player
So I can see a realistic game of life
I want cells to live if they have two or three neighbours

As a player
So I can see a realistic game of life
I want cells to die if they have more than three neighbours

As a player
So I can see a realistic game of life
I want a dead cell to come alive if it has three neighbours
